## Data source

As described in the instructions the code was downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip


## Transformations

### Stage 1
Read both the test and training files for activity
```(r)
    test_activity <- read.table("data/UCI HAR Dataset/test/Y_test.txt")
    train_activity <- read.table("data/UCI HAR Dataset/train/Y_train.txt")
```
Combine into a single table.
```(r)
    all_activities <- rbind(test_activity,train_activity)
    names(all_activities)<-c("activity")
```
Convert activities into readable labels
```(r)
    activity_labels <- read.table("data/UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt")
    all_activities$activity <- factor(all_activities$activity, levels=activity_labels[,1], labels = activity_labels[,2])
```
